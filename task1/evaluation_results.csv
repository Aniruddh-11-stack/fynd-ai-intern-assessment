There are no explicit negative points mentioned in the review. The consistent praise, especially considering the large group size, suggests a positive experience.

This location specifically has a good pharmacy, organic/health section, well-stocked bakery/deli, reasonable parking, and convenient access to other stores. The reviewer also values the unique product selection at this location that they can't find at other Fry's. The only negative point is a cautionary note about being firm with the deli staff to avoid being shortchanged, but the reviewer also empathizes with the staff, attributing any issues to low wages. The mention of the parking issue from another review is acknowledged but dismissed as something likely out of Fry's control.

The 'sweetness' of the employee is a minor positive, but it's overshadowed by the spelling error.

There are two minor criticisms: the styrofoam cups and the limited drink size options. These are relatively minor compared to the strong praise for the burger itself and the overall experience.

*   **Best Option:** ""By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.""
*   **Experience:** ""Worth a visit to Talking Stick"" and the reviewer has visited ""probably 20 times"".

**Negative Aspects:**
*   **Ambiance:** ""Just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor,"" ""definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away.""

**Weighing the Aspects:**
While the ambiance is not ideal, the reviewer emphasizes the exceptional food quality, value, service, and the fact that they are a repeat customer. The positive aspects strongly outweigh the negative.

Weighing the factors: The negative aspects (broken equipment, higher prices, and an overall feeling of ""meh"") outweigh the positive aspects (nice garden department and short checkout times).

The conclusion ('Is this the best you can do?') indicates significant disappointment. The $120 price tag is also considered not worth it given the quality. Thus, a 2-star rating reflects the overall negative experience, despite the positive service.",True,Chain-of-Thought
1,1,"The review expresses significant dissatisfaction. While the service is praised as 'excellent' and 'highly attentive,' the overwhelming majority of the review focuses on negative aspects. The food is described as 'absolutely horrible,' with specific complaints about the steak's quality, thickness, and preparation ('mostly fat, gristle'). The salad is compared unfavorably to Chick-fil-A, the veggies are 'blah,' and the bread is stale. Furthermore, the reviewer criticizes the cramped seating arrangement and unpleasant eavesdropping on other diners. The high price point ($150) is contrasted with the poor quality, leading the reviewer to vow to dine elsewhere in the future. The positive mention of service is not enough to offset the numerous negative points, indicating a very poor experience.",True,Chain-of-Thought
1,1,"This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer immediately compares the place to a ""To Catch A Predator"" set, indicating a feeling of unease and potential impropriety. They further suggest the place caters to or attracts people with questionable inclinations, referencing Kubrick's Lolita. The bar is criticized for poorly made drinks (""Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution""). The decor is said to need a facelift. While there are a few reluctant pluses (might be appealing to under 21s, ok first club experience, DJ plays hip-hop), these are heavily overshadowed by the negative comments and the overall tone of the review, which implies the place is frequented by shady individuals. The final description of the patrons cements the extremely negative impression, leading to a very low star rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,2,"The review expresses mixed feelings. Initially, the author appreciates the view from South Mountain, indicating a positive experience. However, the majority of the review details a negative experience of getting lost and the frustration associated with poorly marked trails. The author uses phrases like ""rocky labyrinth,"" ""windy, disjointed roads,"" ""damn golf course,"" ""damn South Mountain,"" and ""damn unmarked trails"" to emphasize their frustration. While they acknowledge the kindness of the hiker who gave them a ride, the overall tone suggests a negative experience due to the lack of clear trail markings and the feeling of being lost and potentially unsafe. The initial positive view is quickly overshadowed and strongly countered by the negative experiences. Therefore, a 2-star rating reflects the negative experience and frustration with the hiking trails.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,5,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses enthusiastic language like ""Mmmmm"", ""Great food"", ""to die for"", ""wonderful lasting impression"", and ""wonderful and quick service"". The only potential negative is the price, but the reviewer immediately dismisses this by stating that it's expected at a W Hotel and doesn't seem to mind. They also explicitly recommend the place. All these indicators point to a very positive experience, justifying a 5-star rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,5,"The review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment. Here's a breakdown: 

*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Friendly and kind staff, especially towards the reviewer's toddler.
    *   Food is described as ""rocks"" and being really good within the reviewer's limited choices.
    *   Staff suggested alternative dishes.
    *   Prices are a bargain for entrees.
    *   The restaurant delivers on spice levels, fulfilling requests to make it very hot.
    *   Described as the ""best bargain in North Phoenix for spice hounds.""

*   **Negative Aspects:**
    *   The only slightly negative point is the ""Decor functional"" which is mild and doesn't significantly detract from the overall experience. Since the decor is not criticised for being unpleasant, this is still an indication of satisfactory function.

Considering the strong positive language (e.g., ""rocks,"" ""best bargain,"" ""really kind,"" ""bargain,"" getting spice requests right) and the minimal negative feedback, a 5-star rating is most appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,4,"The review expresses mostly positive sentiments. The customer mentions the store being nice and well-organized, the sales people being nice and not pushy, a good selection of quality products, appreciation for the coupons, and enjoyment in browsing the store, particularly the kitchen gadget section.

Thus, a 4-star rating seems appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The reviewer uses emphatic language such as ""ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD"" and describes the salad with positive adjectives like ""fresh, clean, sweet, crisp, light."" They also praise the setting as ""very well appointed"" and note the quality of the iced tea, which is hard to find. The call to action ""Go there...Eat there...you will like it"" further reinforces the positive sentiment. There are no negative comments or complaints. Therefore, a 5-star rating is appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,5,"This is an overwhelmingly positive review. The author expresses excitement due to their husband's intense love for sushi and their search for a great sushi place after relocating. They were initially hesitant due to mixed Yelp reviews but were very pleased with their experience. Positive aspects include: delicious miso soup, seaweed salad, and tako salad; a ""divine"" peppered seared tuna; huge and satisfying specialty rolls; fair pricing; and a desire to return and try the teppan. The only minor negative is the strange interior, but they easily made themselves comfortable. The enthusiastic language and clear intention to return strongly suggest a 5-star experience.",True,Chain-of-Thought
1,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative. The customer explicitly states 'WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.' The negative aspects include: lateness (taxi was late by over 20 minutes), being misled about the taxi's location ('right around the corner' when it was not), the driver getting lost, the taxi service not knowing how to navigate the area, the customer missing a class and losing money, and the customer's time being wasted. There are no positive aspects mentioned. The intense frustration and financial loss clearly indicate a 1-star experience.",True,Chain-of-Thought
1,1,"The review expresses significant disappointment and frustration. It contrasts the current establishment unfavorably with the previous owners/staff, highlighting the friendly service and quality food that earned good reviews before. The reviewer then lists several negative aspects of the current food: mislabeled lemon chicken (actually pork and of poor quality), falling-apart wontons, and excessively greasy lo mein and eggrolls. The overall tone is extremely negative, indicating the reviewer finds the food 'truly awful' and prefers Panda Express, implying a very low quality experience. The multiple 'hopeful tries' mentioned suggest this isn't a one-off bad experience. Given the overwhelmingly negative feedback, a 1-star rating is most appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,3,"The review expresses a slightly positive sentiment overall. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Positive:** ""I like it better then Denny's"" and ""I would pick waffle house for sure"" indicate a preference for Waffle House over Denny's. The reviewer also mentions they ""stop on by to get some breakfast"", suggesting a recurring behavior.
*   **Negative:** ""It's okay not the best place in the world"" reveals that the reviewer doesn't think highly of the restaurant's quality; it is just ""okay"".

Weighing the factors: The preference and recurring visits suggest a positive experience, but the admission that it's not the ""best place in the world"" brings it down. Therefore, a 3-star rating feels appropriate because it indicates an average, acceptable experience with some clear positive aspects but also some limitations.",True,Chain-of-Thought

Positive aspects include: a unique experience combining dining with a zoo/aquarium/aviary atmosphere; no wait time; a great view near the pond; active wildlife that entertained the kids; decent guacamole; and good salsa. The only mildly negative point is that the food is described as ""fairly decent,"" but the atmosphere seems to heavily outweigh this, and the reviewer recommends visiting specifically for the atmosphere, implying it's the main draw. The mention of a picture further enhances the positive experience. Overall, the positive aspects far outweigh the slightly lukewarm comment on the food, suggesting a 4-star rating is appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The reviewer highlights several positive aspects: longstanding loyalty (""been going for years""), consistency in style (""stayed true to their own style""), delicious food, decent prices, friendly staff, and good customer service (""no problem fixing"" issues). The only negative is the mention of the place being ""a bit shabby,"" but this is presented mildly and does not seem to significantly detract from the overall positive experience.

The reviewer also states they are generally supportive of independent downtown businesses. However, there are significant negatives: high drink prices, a lack of well options, and uncertainty about the viability of an outdoor ""dance club."" The reviewer explicitly states the need for changes to encourage a return visit. The balance tips slightly towards neutral/slightly negative due to specific complaints about pricing and selection, tempering the positive aspects of the layout and view. A 3-star rating reflects this mixed opinion.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The food is described in glowing terms ('melted in my mouth', 'so worth it'). The atmosphere is lauded as 'great' and 'fun'. The service is described as 'good', and the flexible Sunday hours are a plus. The phrase 'I would definitely go back' is a strong indicator of high satisfaction. The negative aspect is almost immediately turned into a positive. Therefore, a 5-star rating is most appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought

However, the bulk of the review focuses on negative experiences during a recent visit. These include: price increase coupled with a significant reduction in portion size ('cut the portion in half'), lack of assistance from staff in setting up tables ('we had to do it ourselves'), and poorly prepared tea ('just thrown into a small metal tea pot') with missing condiments that had to be requested. The concluding statement indicates the reviewers have decided to find better alternatives. The overwhelming negativity significantly outweighs the initial positive memory, warranting a low rating.

The customer attempted to visit the salon twice, first arriving an hour before the posted opening time (which is understandable), but then returning at the stated opening time of 10am only to find the salon closed and dark.

They conclude with a statement that they ""don't plan on returning"" and that ""there are better places near downtown Chandler"", both indicating dissatisfaction. The overwhelming negativity suggests a low rating. I chose 2 stars because there was a neutral comment about the beans and the review didn't express extreme anger, just disappointment.",True,Chain-of-Thought

Positive aspects include giant Jenga, dancing, multiple levels & bars, a great outdoor space, and efficient bar staff. The negative aspects are the condition of the facilities (especially the bathrooms) and that it is best enjoyed with a large group. The food is described as ""decent,"" which is neutral. While the bathroom and large group preference are drawbacks, the overall experience seems quite positive, meriting a 4-star rating. The reviewer also returned for a second visit (bachelorette party), which further supports a positive sentiment even if the experience wasn't perfect the second time around.",True,Chain-of-Thought

However, the reviewer expects more from a Target located in an 'Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center' and questions the lack of a 'Flagship Target' experience. The major negative points revolve around 'atrocious' traffic and parking at Desert Ridge, leading the reviewer to choose Targets (and even Walmarts) further away. The parking/traffic issue is significant and impacts the customer's experience considerably. While the initial statement about consistency is positive, the overall sentiment seems more critical, suggesting an average rating. A 3-star rating reflects a middle ground where the reviewer acknowledges a standard experience but expresses disappointment and frustration.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The gelato is also negatively described. Although the reviewer admits it's 'Better than Pizza Hut,' the overall tone is negative, highlighting unmet expectations due to the perceived 'fuss and flash.'

While the carne asada taco brought the experience down, the reviewer explicitly states they are glad they found the restaurant and will definitely visit again.

The service is described as ""excellent"" and specifically thanks Owen. The review also highlights the extensive wine selection and unique beer and non-alcoholic soda options.

The negative aspects are the slowness of the service, with long wait times for food, and the fact that many dishes were just ""basic"". The reviewer states they *WILL* return. Considering the strongly positive experience with the Pate Chaude and rolls, the positive impression of the atmosphere, the explicit statement of 4 stars by the reviewer for specific items, and the intention to return, while acknowledging the slow service and some mediocre dishes, a 4-star rating is the most accurate reflection of the overall sentiment.",True,Chain-of-Thought

It highlights several positive aspects like its location (hidden jewel, just off the main drag, perfect for a weekend getaway), complimentary breakfast (nice, real plates and utensils), free WIFI, huge rooms, and suitability for families (separate sleeping areas). The only negative is the small and underwhelming pool. The reviewer explicitly states that the pool is the only reason for not giving a perfect 5-star rating, indicating that the negative is relatively minor compared to the numerous positives.

However, the restaurant rectified the situation by removing the Gyro from the bill, and the waitress (owner's daughter) promised to address the issue. The fact that the restaurant was responsive to the problem and the overall positive experience (food and ambiance) contribute to a higher rating. A 4-star rating reflects the good experience, while acknowledging the initial Gyro issue.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The connection to a coffee shop is also mentioned without explicit negativity, implying a potential positive. However, the overwhelming negative sentiment revolves around the price. The reviewer uses hyperbole (""thousand dollars"") and direct negative statements (""fool parting with his money"") to express extreme dissatisfaction with the cost. While they concede that the ice cream was ""tasty"", the final comment that gives the star rating is ""Two stars because it actually was tasty.""

They also mention wanting to try the rose on a future visit. On the negative side, the reviewer was disappointed with the baked escargots, finding the puff pastry too crunchy and the overall flavor underwhelming. Their mother didn't enjoy most of the dishes, which contributed to the negative experience. The reviewer also implies the escargot's puff pastry being overly crunchy was a notable negative. While the reviewer ate everything, the overall impression is that the experience was only moderately positive, leaning towards a 3-star rating.

However, the bulk of the review focuses on a significantly negative experience over the last 6 months. The consistent rudeness and inattentiveness of the bartender, leading to the reviewer walking out on multiple occasions, heavily outweighs the positive aspects. The reviewer explicitly states they would not recommend the restaurant despite liking the food, due to the poor customer service. The sentiment of betrayal and disappointment, coupled with the repeated negative encounters, clearly indicate a low rating.

The positive aspects include knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly salespeople, good recommendations, a good selection of cheap anime (even though possibly bootlegged), and a generally positive experience at this location compared to other Atomic Comics. The major negative aspect is that they no longer sell D&D books or dice, which was a significant draw for the reviewer. The reviewer explicitly states that without the D&D books being removed, they would have given a 4-star rating. The bootleg anime is mentioned, but the reviewer admits they don't care about it, but states they have trouble with playback, suggesting a negative element.

The use of phrases like ""Slow indifferent service"" and ""Mediocre food"" further solidify the negative assessment. The initial statement about ""THE TROUGH SLURPERS"" and their inflated ratings also indicates a fundamental disagreement with other reviewers, suggesting a very low personal rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought

However, the negative aspects outweigh the positives. The reviewer felt the price was high, there was no itemized receipt, the delivery person provided no explanation for the cost, and a $4 delivery charge was added without prior notification. The reviewer explicitly states they ""hate having extra charges slipped onto my bill with no explanation"" and that ""this will probably be the last time we order."" This strong negative sentiment regarding pricing transparency and customer service overshadows the initial positive impression of the food's quality and convenience, resulting in a low star rating.

The reviewer explicitly states that the last two positive aspects are what prevent the review from being a complete ""Meh.""

Negative aspects:

*   Small menu with high prices and limited flexibility
*   Multiple negative experiences (two visits)

Despite the attempts at positivity and acknowledging others' positive experiences, the specific details of the reviewer's own experiences are overwhelmingly negative. The comments about the food, service, and atmosphere indicate significant issues. Because of this, the review is closer to a negative experience.

I am inferring that ""bohemian bloodletting"" is negative since it sounds unpleasant. Given that the person explicitly states ""I do enjoy this coffee shop"" and ""it's still a nice place for coffee,"" a 4-star rating seems appropriate, acknowledging both the good and the less desirable aspects.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,4,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses phrases like ""just delicious!"", ""WHOOP WHOOP!"", ""Really good"", ""big fan of Pad Thai"", ""really good as well!"", and ""Cheap!"". The reviewer highlights quick service and enjoyment of multiple dishes (Pad Thai, chicken sa tay, spring rolls, and the boyfriend enjoying the chow mein). The only significant negative is the dislike of the sweet and sour pork, which is mitigated by the fact that the reviewer enjoys other dishes. The lack of spiciness in the Pad Thai is also mentioned, but presented as a manageable issue. Overall, the positive experiences outweigh the single negative, suggesting a rating of 4 stars.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,3,"The review expresses both positive and neutral/slightly negative sentiments. 

Positive Aspects:
* ""Very good and perfect for a light dinner"" - refers to the appetizer platter.
* ""best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow!"" - enthusiastic praise for the lemonade.
* ""service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by"" - positive experience with the service.

Negative/Neutral Aspects:
* Sharing an appetizer and having it be sufficient for a light dinner suggests portions might be a little small, or at least not overly generous (though this isn't explicitly negative).

Overall, the review is fairly positive, highlighting the food quality (appetizer platter and especially lemonade) and service. However, the reviewer explicitly states 'I give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!' so that will be the final rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,5,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Crust: crispy, thin, foldable, crispy and bubbly edges
    *   Mozzarella: Great
    *   Toppings: Never disappointed
    *   Grease: Appreciated, a sign of good pizza
    *   Comparison to NY Pizza: A huge compliment from a self-proclaimed pizza snob
    *   Overall Impression: Fills the void of a good NY pizza place.
    *   Direct compliment to the pizza maker: 'You make a good pizza.'

*   **Negative Aspects:**
    *   Mention of grease, but the reviewer sees it as a positive.

Weighing these aspects, the positives far outweigh the negligible negatives. The reviewer is explicitly enthusiastic and compares the pizza favorably to New York style, which is their benchmark. The exclamation of ""Yo! Tony! You make a good pizza."" seals the deal as highly positive.",True,Chain-of-Thought
5,5,"The review starts with a general dislike for botanical gardens, indicating a potentially negative bias. However, the reviewer explicitly states that the Desert Botanical Gardens is an *exception* to their cynicism. The reviewer uses very positive language to describe the cacti, such as ""like they are from another planet"", ""huge bizarre formations"", and ""never knew such bizarre life forms existed"". They also praise the wildlife sightings and the educational value of the garden. The phrase ""This place never grows old"" strongly reinforces a positive sentiment. While the opening paragraph expresses a general reservation about botanical gardens, the overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic descriptions of the Desert Botanical Gardens clearly outweigh this initial negativity, leading to a predicted rating of 5 stars.",True,Chain-of-Thought
5,5,"This is overwhelmingly a positive review. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Thanks fellow yelpers for bringing them there (positive recommendation)
    *   Husband loved the beer sampler (10 beers for $9, good value)
    *   Cider was exactly what reviewer needed
    *   Fries were awesome (beer batter)
    *   Husband raved about the carne adovada (so good he'd consider flying back for it)
    *   Great atmosphere (laid back, fun to sit amongst beer making)
    *   High recommendation

*   **Negative Aspects:**
    *   Turkey burger was ""standard"" (slightly negative, but not a major complaint)

Considering the overwhelming positivity and strong recommendation, a 5-star rating is appropriate. The one slightly negative comment about the turkey burger being ""standard"" is minor in comparison to the numerous positive comments and enthusiastic endorsement.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,4,"The review mentions both positive and negative aspects. The spring rolls and lemongrass chicken are rated as 3-star, indicating they were average. However, the chicken curry is described as ""really good,"" suggesting a significantly positive experience with that dish. The coconut water is described as fresh, which is another positive point. The reasonable price ($30) also contributes positively. Considering the curry was a highlight and offset the average dishes, and the other positives, a 4-star rating seems appropriate. While some items were just okay, the overall experience appears above average due to the excellent curry and fair prices.",True,Chain-of-Thought
2,2,"The review presents a mixed bag of experiences. On the positive side, the nachos are described as large, delicious, and customizable. This is a significant highlight. However, there are several negative aspects: the regular dishes are only ""OK"" and overpriced, comparable to cheaper alternatives; the restaurant is always empty, even during peak hours; and, most importantly, the service is described as ""awful."" The reviewer details a specific negative encounter with an overly eager waiter who repeatedly tried to take their plates before they were finished, followed by slow drink refills. The reviewer concludes by recommending a different restaurant due to its better food and service. The strong negative points about the service and the food quality being only ""OK"" for the price outweigh the positive comments about the nachos. Therefore, a rating of 2 stars seems appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
5,5,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses gratitude for the opportunity, praises the performance as 'terrific', and highlights the actors' talent and the quality of the musical's execution. They specifically mention enjoying the comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow present in the performance. While they acknowledge the financial burden of live theater compared to movies, they ultimately conclude that the investment is worth it for a 'highly-memorable night'. The enthusiastic recommendation and repeated expressions of enjoyment strongly suggest a 5-star experience.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,4,"The review expresses overall positive sentiment. It praises the restaurant's ability to create an immersive atmosphere despite its location, the sampler for offering diverse and enjoyable island interpretations of meats, and the tostones (referred to humorously with 'going bananas'). The reviewer also acknowledges the quality of Cuban cuisine in general. While there's a slightly political tone with references to the Castro brothers and ""Viva La Revolucion"", the context suggests it's more of a playful appreciation of Cuban culture and food rather than a genuine political endorsement. The positive remarks about the food and atmosphere outweigh any potential negativity implied by the political references. Therefore, a 4-star rating seems appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
1,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses strong negative language like ""Disgusting!"", ""very outdated and gaudy"", ""pretty bad"", and ""no flavor at all!"". The mention of the 80's style interior and Sopranos is not necessarily positive; it contributes to a negative impression of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the reviewer accuses the restaurant of fabricating positive reviews, which strongly indicates extreme dissatisfaction. Given the complete lack of positive feedback and the strong negative tone, a 1-star rating is most appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
2,2,"The review expresses several negative sentiments that outweigh the positive ones. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Food was decent/good (mentioned a couple of times).
    *   Service was good.

*   **Negative Aspects:**
    *   Overpriced: This is the biggest complaint, explicitly mentioning $60+ for a light meal for two, and comparing the cost unfavorably to other comparable restaurants.
    *   Food quality not justifying the price: The reviewer felt they could have easily made the same dishes at home, suggesting the food wasn't exceptional.
    *   Pretentious ambiance: This adds another layer of negativity, making the experience less enjoyable.
    *   Not planning a return: A strong indicator of dissatisfaction.
    *   Feels they've had the same meal many times before, suggesting a lack of uniqueness or value.

*   **Weighing:**
    *   While the food and service are described as ""good,"" the overwhelming focus is on the excessive price and the feeling of not getting enough value for the money. The combination of high cost, mediocre food (relative to cost), and pretentious atmosphere leaves a strongly negative impression. The reviewer even implies a desire to correct perceived inflated ratings. The explicit statement of not planning a return further cements the negative sentiment.

Considering these factors, a 2-star rating is most appropriate. A 3-star rating would imply a more balanced experience, which is not the case here. A 1-star rating might be too harsh, as the reviewer did acknowledge some positive aspects, but the overriding negative sentiment makes 2 stars the most reasonable prediction.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,3,"The review expresses both positive and negative sentiments. Positive aspects include: liking the restaurant in general, a great happy hour, enjoyment of the small bites (baby back ribs, despite the small portions), a good atmosphere, and good service. The main negative is the loud music, which is a significant detractor. The reviewer explicitly states ""Three solid stars from me,"" which aligns with a balanced assessment of positive qualities offset by a notable drawback.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,5,"The review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment. It begins by stating the restaurant is ""Always reliably good,"" a strong endorsement. It then highlights several positive aspects: ""Great beer selection,"" ""fabulous 'bitch fizz' (ciders, etc.) and cocktails,"" ""pizza is outstanding,"" and a ""healthy menu."" The reviewer also mentions a preference to avoid chains, but considers this restaurant an ""exception,"" further reinforcing its positive image. There are no negative aspects mentioned, leading to a prediction of 5 stars.",True,Chain-of-Thought
2,3,"This review is mixed. On the negative side, the author's car broke down at the gas station, which created a stressful situation. They also felt that other customers were unhelpful. On the positive side, they were eventually helped by two teenagers. The author expresses gratitude towards those who helped, and the gas station itself isn't directly responsible for the car trouble. The review is more of a narrative of an unfortunate situation that happened at the gas station rather than a direct critique of the station's services or offerings. Given the overall tone and the eventual resolution, a neutral rating of 3 stars seems appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
1,1,"The review primarily focuses on negative experiences. The reviewer explicitly states the service was ""awful"" and ""poor."" The lengthy wait times (over 15 minutes twice) and the server's nonchalant attitude are strong negative indicators. The food being ""just okay"" is a neutral point but doesn't outweigh the poor service. The final sentence, ""Won't be going back,"" reinforces the negative sentiment and suggests a very unsatisfactory experience. Therefore, a 1-star rating is most appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,5,"The review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The opening statement, ""Finally, a pizza place that satisfies the individual pizza taste buds of my family!"" indicates significant approval and relief. The phrase ""both were delicious!"" is a direct positive statement about the food quality. Furthermore, ""Everyone left happy"" confirms a positive overall experience. There are no negative points mentioned, making a 5-star rating appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The reviewer explicitly states that the place is ""right up my alley"" and lists several positive attributes: Smithwick's on tap, awesome fish & chips (award-winning), a good pub vibe with live music, and a nice soccer following (even though it's not their preferred team). The reviewer even mentions they would rate it 4 & 1/4 stars. While the sentiment isn't perfect (the reviewer acknowledges it's not *their* soccer club), the positive aspects clearly outweigh the minor negative. Rounding down the stated 4 & 1/4 leads to a predicted rating of 4 stars.",True,Chain-of-Thought
5,5,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. While the initial description of the location (teeny dimly lit road, medical office building) has a slightly negative connotation, it is quickly followed by the discovery of ""the amazing Fuego Bistro."" The review then lists numerous positive aspects: ""perfect meal,"" ""amazing ambiance,"" ""twinkly lights,"" ""live musician,"" ""great wine,"" ""unique and delicious food,"" and ""highlight of our trip."" The enthusiastic recommendation to Phoenix residents and the reviewer's intention to return from Chicago further cement the positive sentiment, strongly suggesting a 5-star rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought

Given the sustained patronage and general positive comments, a 4-star rating is most appropriate.",True,Chain-of-Thought

Positive aspects include: impressive experience for a travel consultant, good value for the price, stylish (though compared to other options), excellent staff and service (Kimpton training), stylish Italian restaurant with unique menu and ambiance, and admirable job overall on the property makeover. The only significant negative is that the room makeovers aren't fully complete, and the older carpeting is disappointing. While this is a valid criticism, it is overshadowed by the numerous positive comments, especially the praise for the staff, service, restaurant, and overall improvement of the property. The reviewer also uses positive language like ""unquestionable value"", ""chic desert retreat"", ""high marks"", ""admirable and feverish job"", and ""kudos"". A rating of 4 stars reflects the generally positive experience tempered by the room quality issues.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,3,"This review starts with strong positivity, expressing love for Pita Jungle and a desire for their food ('have to get my fix'). The initial impressions of the location are also positive (well-decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating, greeted quickly). However, several negative points are raised: the temperature being too warm, a very slow soup arrival, dislike of the soup's taste and appearance, and the check being presented before the food arrived. While the reviewer states they 'dig this place' despite the problems, the accumulation of negative experiences (especially related to the food and service) significantly detracts from the overall positive impression. The positives were strong initially but the negatives are specific and impactful, leading to a slightly above average rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,4,"This review is largely positive, despite the implied limited personal interest ('I only go here when my little cousin is in town'). The reviewer highlights several features that a 4-year-old enjoys, specifically the train displays and ride. The concluding statement 'A definite place to go with little kids especially if they like the trains' reinforces the positive recommendation for a specific demographic. While there's no explicit mention of food, service, or other general aspects, the enthusiastic endorsement for its target audience warrants a high rating. Because it's specifically good for a niche audience and the reviewer seems to only go due to the cousin's interest, and not necessarily for their own enjoyment, it's not a perfect 5 stars.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,3,"The review expresses mixed feelings. The reviewer initially had high hopes and appreciated the British-themed atmosphere and beer selection. However, the smell reminded them of their grandma's house (which is a neutral/slightly negative association), the music selection was off-putting, and they only express a lukewarm desire to return for food or drinks (only on a busy night). The positive aspects include the atmosphere, beer selection, cozy nooks, and the presence of soccer on TV. Overall, the negatives slightly outweigh the positives, leading to a middle-ground rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
4,4,"The review starts with negative expectations based on the restaurant's name, but these expectations are quickly subverted. The reviewer praises the sandwich, calling it 'one of the best sandwiches I have ever had,' highlighting the 'great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread' and other ingredients. The reviewer expresses a positive surprise, especially considering their initial perception of what ""The Lodge"" would be like. The only real negative points are the mildly disturbing decor (taxidermied animals) and the incident with the shirtless person at the bar. While the shirtless incident is a significant detractor, the overall positive experience with the food and the expressed surprise at the restaurant's quality outweigh this. The reviewer ends on a slightly negative note, but the positive sentiment towards the food and overall experience is stronger, leading to a rating slightly above average.",True,Chain-of-Thought
5,4,"The review expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer is clearly impressed with the historical significance of the location and the way the tour guides bring Frank Lloyd Wright's vision to life. Phrases like ""indescribably cool"" and ""This is not to be missed!"" strongly indicate a positive experience. The only negative point is the mention of ""disrepair"" in some rooms, but this is mitigated by the reviewer's willingness to contribute to repairs through the gift shop, and the overall tone remains highly favorable. Therefore, a 4-star rating seems appropriate, reflecting a very positive experience with a minor drawback.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The reviewer 'highly recommend[s]' the place and hopes to return. There are no negative aspects mentioned. All of this strongly suggests a 5-star rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought

Key positives include: great food (especially the garlic appetizer), good pizza (despite low expectations), a great bartender, a cozy and romantic ambiance, and a unique setting with cave-like nooks. The main negatives revolve around the service during the first visit: the server disappearing before the meal arrived and a period of inattentive service. However, the reviewer is forgiving of this, stating they ""don't care as long as I get good service"" and that the ambiance and company made the service issues barely noticeable. The reviewer also mentions the restaurant is not cheap, but this is offset by the description of it as a ""finer dining establishment."" Because the reviewer remembers the food so fondly and clearly enjoyed the atmosphere, despite some service issues, the review warrants a 4-star rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
3,2,"The review expresses a mixed sentiment, but leans negative. The reviewer states the food is ""just ok,"" which is neutral or slightly negative. However, they strongly criticize the price, stating it's ""way overpriced"" and calling $9 for loco moco ""outrageous!"" This strong negative sentiment regarding the price outweighs the neutral comment about the food, leading to a low rating. I chose 2 stars because the food isn't described as *bad*, but the extreme dissatisfaction with the price significantly impacts the overall experience.",True,Chain-of-Thought

    *   Customer went to extra lengths to purchase items directly from artists, bypassing the store.

*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Customer liked some of the items and wanted to buy them.

Despite the customer finding items they wanted, the extremely negative experience with the service overshadows any potential positive aspects. The customer's actions (contacting the artists directly to avoid the store) further emphasizes their dissatisfaction.

The negative aspects are relatively minor: the salads being a little sweet, the price being high, and the feeling of being a ""trendy little scottsdale frou-frou.""

The reviewer states ""I really enjoyed this little burger place,"" and highlights positive aspects such as the ""fancy"" and ""modern"" setting and the ""sweet potato french fries...Mmmmm!""

There are no negative comments to weigh against these positives, indicating a strong positive sentiment and deserving of a 5-star rating.",True,Chain-of-Thought
5,5,"The review explicitly states the 5-star rating is *only* for the happy hour menu. It then goes on to rave about the happy hour menu, praising the cheap drinks and food options available. The reviewer specifically mentions $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, providing examples like burgers, wings, and tacos. They highlight the generous happy hour times. While there is a minor negative comment about the ""fish chili"" and a parking validation issue mentioned at the end, the strong positive sentiment towards the happy hour overwhelms these negatives.

However, the reviewer acknowledges the reason for the slow service (""place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time"") and finds the noise ""within reason.""

2,2,"The review starts with a negative statement: ""Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat."" This immediately sets a negative tone. While the reviewer acknowledges that it might be enjoyable for teenagers wanting a shake or ice cream, this is a specific niche and doesn't redeem the overall negative impression of the food quality. The use of a smiley face at the end doesn't negate the negative opening statement. The overall sentiment leans heavily negative, suggesting a low rating. I chose a 2 star rating as the review isn't completely damning, but still holds a largely negative sentiment.",True,Chain-of-Thought

The reviewer also mentions they wouldn't go out of their way to visit but would return if in the neighborhood. This indicates a generally positive but not exceptional experience.

The dessert is a highlight, and the soup is described as good but salty.
